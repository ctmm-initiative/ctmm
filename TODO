UPDATE [pREML] TODO
* make ctmm.select robust to use MLE guesses (through R environments?)
* ctmm.fit PARS==0 : MLE, pREML, REML consistency
* document pREML

Aligned Krige UDs
pregridder composite dimension?

LOW HANGING FRUIT & Nagging issues
* use COV for parscale if present
* t argument of simulate.telemetry not being used correctly?
* compass plot
* summary.telemetry.list like Dong's
* unit Environment on plots for points()
* basic trace option for ctmm.fit
* parallelize ctmm.select
* individualized projections
* 1-point azimuthal equidistant projection quick option
* overload covm * / to apply to area & matrix
* plot.telemetry with HDOP & UERE
* str.ctmm, str.telemetry (print too?)
* don't delete mean off of IOU and BM... need that to Krige I think...
* IOU with drift not setup correctly
* points methods units environment
* UERE priors from calibration
* store fixed error in data
* have summary return a warning on occurrence distributions
* variogram.list <- mean-lapply-variogram
* occurrence.list
  + need to choose/enforce the same time steps?
  + weight by period of data?
* mean.UD on occurrence objects; +1 DOF
* simulate.UD
* Bayesian simulate.ctmm models (not data)
* krige velocities, activity plot
* put overlap in vignette after publication
* predict plot with transparency proportional to uncertainty (Google Earth?)
* mean.ctmm: list -> iid

PERIODIC 0.4.0
* simulate.telemetry (not pure ctmm)
* smoother (velocity vector--check)
* akde... slow exact and fast approximation or block toeplitz matrix
* plot ctmm
* vignette: periodogram, ctmm.select
* maned wolf data: individually projected subset in reserve with largest daily periodicities and no weekly periodicity
  + submit to Rogerio first to check over, ask about MoveBank DOI
  + get MoveBank DOI

generalize Gaussian area?
  UDs for both mean and population
  homerange(method=normal)
time/tube plot 
periodic plot.ctmm

level.UD of summary UD/ctmm return Inf
  test p-value against sample size

summary on z-axis ctmm.fit might be buggy

sort.ctmm
sort.list
name.ctmm
name.generic

zoom.telemetry x,y offset clicker

global variable for units of current plot?

proj4: email about making north up
plot N vector in corner

dogleg splines
  degree = 1,2?
  migration = times?
  settlement = times?

model option vignette
IID, OU, OUF, (an)isotropic table in vignette

fixed circulation option?
Fixed period parameters during fitting?

3d periodogram, ctmm.fit, krige, kde

simulate nsim in both unconditioned and conditionedb by storing all objects
multiple conditional simulations loop
More efficient sampler/smoother: 
store propagator results for all time-lags
store forecast/concurrent estimates
call vectorized RNG

Include telemetry errors in unconditional simulation?
krige -> predict

cross variogram

Newton-Raphson iteration at end of ctmm.fit for solution check on optim

AKDE vignette: DOF.H, DOF.mu

plot options: cex, type, abrv

AKDE with errors, weights
akde with user-specified grid (and projection)

residual acf versus data acf with correct confidence intervals for no autocorrelation null hypothesis

multi-scale variogram bias correction
variogram & periodogram: coarsening window method to avoid all bias

population fitting without correlation
population fit of list
population akde of lists

optional columns with NAs are being discarded
or maybe report if NAs are discarded?

Lapack GE solve -> Lapack PO/SY solve.

as.telemetry option: minimal columns, maximum columns, specified columns to keep

profile CIs

contour labels in plot ctmm

Email ks author about inaccuracy

Repeated times in variograms -- account for as error -- fix cap
