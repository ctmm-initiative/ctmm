* ctmm.select run OUf.isotropic before OUf.anisotropic with OU/OUF.anisotropic + OUf.isotropic parameters
* ctmm.select optimize f of OUf in isolation first?
* ctmm.select optimize Omega of OUO in isolation first?
* prediction COV should be called VAR if length(axes)==1 or call everything COV
* optimize: was rank-1 update correlation preserving? was it local?
* 2D/3D fix argument for as.telemetry from number of satellites?
* variogram() error on lists
* error vignette should specify that tracking and calibration data have same location classes
